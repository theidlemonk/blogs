So I find out the way I have been askings questions in forums and stuff have been uttlerly confusing to the reader on the otherside. Well I didn't realize that till a few days back when I re-evaluated a few of my questions. Actually what led me to re-evaluate was the fact that the answers I received were more confusing to me. And the reason being, the answers were either their best guess or on a completely different issue/topic. Which is again my fault in a way, as I was not very descriptive or specific in my *ask's*.

Needless to say I did receive a lot of replies that stated *'Could you please be more specific'* or *'Is this local or on the server'*. But, then again, I now understand the reason why. My questions were very precise to me, as I was facing the issue, but it was a terrible explaination to a person who is very likely engaged with completely different priorities.

Here is one of them examples that would make sense. I was having trouble installing ['jekyll'](http://jekyllrb.com/) on my Mac. It was a new thing and I was having some issues with it running. So to put it simple, I thought I had it installed with the server running, but my page wouldn't show up on 'http://0.0.0.0:4000' like it suggested.
So here was my question in the community chat. 

`Q . Can't get jekyll working, need help !!!`

And here were the responses.

`A . What error are you getting?`

`A . Are you on windows? `

`A . What is jekyll? Is this a new chat thing?`

`A . What OS are you on?`

`A . What are you trying to get it to run on?`

`A . Did you check your ruby version? Maybe do a gem update?`

`A . Need more info. Do you have a screenshot. Or could you paste the commands you are tring.`

I had already got seven responses from seven different people trying to helpout, but they were not useful to me. The question was so relevant to me that it got me frustrated. I was not thinking like them, coz I was facing the issue. But later I did realize that my question actually didnt describe the issue at all. It was so generic that all of the replies could've been the solution to a problem when *jekyll* is not working. I needed to be more specific and definitely short as I myself get any ADD kicking in if I scroll through an issue more than two times.

So I realised a good way of asking questions would be to be more specific, provide enough descriptions, and keep it short. Attach a screenshot if possible (More visual the better). Maybe provide short links to things if needed.

Here was my refined question that got me my answer from the first reply.

`Q . Got jekyll (jekyllrb.com) installed on my Mac with the index page and a post. But one running the 'bundle exec jekyll serve' command, it shows the 'Server address: http://0.0.0.0:4000' but when I navigate to it I get a 404.`

Here was the first reply.

`A . I had the same issue. Try to navigate to 'http://localhost:4000' when the server is running.`
